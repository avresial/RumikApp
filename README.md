#   Hi, it is **RumikApp**

At the begining I'd like to mention that it's my first personal project made at that scale. Repo consists of 3 main directories:

1. RumikApp - Main app
2. RumikApp.Tests - Unit tests
3. ApprovalToolForRumikApp - Side app allowing administrator to move data between main and additional databases.

## Simply - **RumikApp** is the app where you go to if you are looking for a Rum

App allow user:

-   Browse external and internal database,
-   Save his own entries,
-   Find new rum depending on his current needs.

## Contents page

1.  [Technologies](#Technologies)
2.  [Generall](#Generall)


#   Technologies <a name="Technologies"></a>

## Generall <a name="Generall"></a>

Whole app is based on .NET Framework and C#.

Below I'm listing couple of technologies that I learned during this project:

-   Linq
-   MVVM
-   Autofac 
-   Xunit and Moq
-   Handling MySQL database
-   Asynchronous programming

At this point app supports only Polish language.

## Future plans

I'm planning to implement Entity framework.
