#   Hi

At the begining I'd like to mention that it's my first personal project made at that scale. Repo consists of 3 main directories:

1. RumikApp - Main app
2. RumikApp.Tests - Tests
3. ApprovalToolForRumikApp - Side app allowing administrator to move data between main and additional databases.

## Contents page

1.  [Technologies](#Technologies)
2.  [Generall](#Generall)
3.  [TestLink](#TestLink)

#   Technologies <a name="Technologies"></a>

## Generall

Whole app is based on .NET Framework and C#.

Below I'm listing couple of technologies that I learned during this project:

-   Linq
-   MVVM
-   Autofac 
-   Xunit and Moq
-   Handling MySQL database
-   Asynchronous programming
